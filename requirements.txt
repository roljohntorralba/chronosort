# Currently no external dependencies required
# The script uses only Python standard library modules:
# - os
# - sys
# - shutil
# - datetime
# - pathlib
# - argparse

# If you need to add dependencies later, list them here
# For example:
# requests>=2.25.0
# pillow>=8.0.0  # If you want to read EXIF data from photos
